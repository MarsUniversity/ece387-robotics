    "# Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Fueled by the introduction of microprocessors in the the 70's, early robotics focused on building complex human robots. Think about the state of sensors, programming languages, processing power, etc in those early years and you can begin to understand why there was so much failure. Eventually, engineers from MIT began to advocate building \"simple\" robust insect like robots with simple understandings, sensors, and control process. Honestly, how complex was your robot in ECE382?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Your World\n",
    "\n",
    "So following a biological path, how do we understand our world and exist in it? Most animals/insects have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sight: from complex human eyes, to dynamic nightvision eyes (cats), to simple grayscale light detectors on bugs\n",
    "- hearing: here I would span the range from voice recognition to being able to decect a sound (hand clapping, see the 90's sensation, [the clapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clapper))\n",
    "- touch: sensing another object is vital to navigation. This could be both physical pressure or LIDAR\n",
    "- emotion: You need something to drive your robot to move or do something. Maybe *emotion* is a strong word, but it is its reason to exist and its purpose that drives it to continue\n",
    "- hunger: eventually, everything needs to eat (recharge) or it dies\n",
    "\n",
    "Many authors have described these with different words, or in different ways, but they are basically all the same. Generally you have to design a robot to do *something* and it will need to sense the world and recharge. This is the simple basis behind the successful Roomba vacuum."

It assumes your inputs are battery chemistry, run-time, speed and the environment you are working in. Depending on your situation, you could have other inputs or one of the inputs, say speed, is totally unimportant so you let the design pick the speed of teh robot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, you all took ECE231, so this shouldn't be too unfamilar to you. Generally, mobile robots (and other embedded systems like cell phones, satellites, etc) are powered by a battery. Let's talk about some of the trade-off or choices you have in robot design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Battery Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Batteries are generally characterized by chemistry, voltage, and capacity. Realize that chemistry also determines a battery's density and hence it's size for a given capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Key Point | Energy Density | Description |\n",
    "|:-----|:----------|:---------------|:------------|\n",
    "| NiMH | Safe | meduim | NiMh batteries are rechargeable and their value (price / capacity / weight) and availability is hard to beat. There is almost no memory effect, meaning every charge should bring the battery up to full capacity. They are safe, if you over charge them, they will dissipate the excess energy as heat (which is why they are warm coming off a charger)|\n",
    "| NiCd | Environmentally bad | low | These batteries are slowly disappearing because of their memory effect: if you don’t discharge the battery properly and then recharge it to full capacity, you lose part of the capacity each time. Also, the cadium is really bad for the environment (very toxic)|\n",
    "| Alkaline | non-rechargable, environmentally bad | high | These are the least expensive batteries in the short term, and provide a higher voltage than NiMh, but are not great for the environment (you must throw them away and they end up in a landfill somewhere), and you constantly need to buy replacements. |\n",
    "| Lead Acid | Old, heavy, low discharge rates | low | Still the cheapest option for high capacity, lead acid is usually reserved for medium/large sized robots because of their incredibly high weight (remember it has lead in it ... heavy). Also, lead acid has life issues. Generally you can not fully discharge them and if they are not routinely charged, they can have [sulfation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery#Sulfation_and_desulfation) and loose capacity. |\n",
    "| LiIon/LiPo | FIRE, small, light, come in many different shapes | high | These are fast becoming the most popular type of battery (especially in the RC toy world) because of their light weight, high discharge rates and relatively good capacity, except the voltages increase in increments of 3.7V, so you need to plan to use LiPo before selecting your electronics and actuators. They are also very dangerous and if mishandled, they will catch file. Samsung is famous for design errors in their Li-ion batteries and costing the company around $20B ... and Samsung has had decades of experience with these batteries. Most other companies (Google, Apple, Dell, etc) have also had issues. Be vary careful with these batteries. |\n",
    "| LiFePO4 | Safer | medium-high | Created by MIT, these are much safer than other lithium batteries, but they do not have the energy density. However, because of the addition of Fe (iron, which is heavy) to the chemistry, if treated correctly, they are much safer than their lithium cousins (because the Fe has a much stronger bond to the oxygen molecules and less like likely to combust). |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Many Batteries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about batteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple batteries\n",
    "    - Pros\n",
    "        - Can make your design simpiler\n",
    "        - Batteries can be at different voltages, sizes, located close to where they are being used, etc\n",
    "        - Reduce cabling harnes complexity and the need to split cables (i.e., Y harness)\n",
    "        - Reduce electrical noise from motors to sensitive electronics, or reduce added hardware to clean up your power system to your electronics\n",
    "    - Cons\n",
    "        - You have to be able to access the multiple batteries and re-charge them\n",
    "        - Added cost and weight\n",
    "        - If batteries are different chemisties, then you may need different types of chargers\n",
    "        - You could be faced with different run-times for different parts of your robot\n",
    "        - You would have to track voltage status of multiple batteries to know when to recharge what battery\n",
    "        - Battery spares become more complex, especially if battery sizes, voltage, chemestry, capcity, etc are different between the multiple batteries\n",
    "- Single batter\n",
    "  - Pros\n",
    "    - Simple charging system\n",
    "    - Entire system has only 1 run-time\n",
    "    - Simple monitoring system because 1 battery\n",
    "    - Few spare batteries needed for logistics\n",
    "  - Cons\n",
    "    - Complex wireing harness\n",
    "    - Need buck/boost converters to change voltage levels to different sub-systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discharge Rate (C rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "Batteries are designed to charge and discharge at certain rates. Going above these rates can be dangerous or life limiting to the battery. Most batteries can discharge at 1C or less and be safe. Some can discharge at 2C or less. The C in this case is their capacity, so a 2000mAhr battery can discharge at 2000mA (or less) for 1 hr and be fine. There are some Li-ion batteries made for RC toys that are designed to discharge at 10C, 20C or 30C. **However, please understand they were designed for that and not all Li-ion batteries can do that.** You should always look at the **datesheet** to understand what a safe discharge rate is for your battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have a robot and need to figure out a battery for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power budget\n",
    "  - electronics and sensors are negligible compared to motors\n",
    "  - 2x Drive Motors: 6V nominal, 1A each under normal load\n",
    "- Battery selection\n",
    "  - Want rechargeable, safe, medium-density, high availability (meaning I can buy the batteries at Target in the checkout line)\n",
    "  - 5x 1.2V AA NiMh Batteries, each providing 2200mAh (equivalent to 2.2Ah) when connected serially will provide 5x1.2V = 6V\n",
    "  - Note that the battery was chosen based on the motor’s nominal voltage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the 6V battery pack will last: 2.2Ah battery / (2 motors x 1A per motor) = 1.1 hrs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat above, but select a 7.4V 3000mAhr Li-ion battery, because we are not worried about fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are going to use a buck converter to lower the 7.4V to 6V for the motors. Our battery provides 7.4V x 3Ahr = 22.2W of power. The buck converter (assume it has no limitation and is 100\\% efficient, will provide 22.2W/6V = 3.7Ahr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the run-time is: 3.7Ahr / (2 motors x 1A per motor) = 1.85 hrs\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if the efficiency was something more realistic like 90\\% for a buck converter, then the run-time would be: .9 x 3.7Ahr / (2 motors x 1A per motor) = 1.65 hrs. So efficiency hurts you, but if you can get 90-96\\% efficient buck converters (which exist), then it isn't that bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a walking robot, hexipod (6 legs, 3 servos per leg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power budget\n",
    "  - 18 servos which operate at 6V nominal and consume 250mA under normal load\n",
    "  - Sensors and electronics are negliable compared to motors\n",
    "- Battery selection\n",
    "  - Want rechargeable, safe, medium-density, high availability\n",
    "  - 10x 1.2V AA NiMh batteries\n",
    "    - 5 serially connected for 6V, 2.2Ahr\n",
    "    - 2 of these connected in parallel for 5S2P configuration giving 6V, 4.4Ahr\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will assume that all motors are under load at all times (i.e. worst case scenario) and therefore all 18 will be consuming a total of 4.5A\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4Ah battery / 4.5A = 0.98 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power System Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "So in all of these cases, we assumed the motors were the largest current draw and electronics/sensors were negligible. That is not allways true, so in real life you would just have to add their power into the power budget and deal in power like we did with Example 2."

    "     - have to spin a lot of wheels, which slip, to get movement so they consume more power\n",

    "So what does this tell us? We know both motors are driving forward (positive velocity), but they are not going the same speed. Therefore we are turning a little. However, our body frame is not aligned with the inertial frame, so although we are moving forward in the x-dir of the body, we are actually moving forward in the inerital y-dir frame. This is navigation ... frames, frames, frames!"
