## Access

- Generate a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) on github
- Add it to your travis account settings by setting [environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) called GITHUB_TOKEN with a value of the personal access token (lots of numbers)
