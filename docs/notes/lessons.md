### Origin 

Rossum’s Universal Robots (R.U.R.) is a 1920 science fiction play by the Czech writer Karel Čapek. It premiered on 25 January 
1921 and introduced the word "robot" to the English language and to science fiction as a whole. In Czech, *robota* means forced 
labor of the kind that serfs had to perform on their masters' lands and is derived from *rab*, meaning "slave".

## Cyborgs

- terminator
- GITS (anime)

A cyborg (short for "cybernetic organism") is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts. The term was coined 
in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; 
it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial 
component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback.[2] While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, 
including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism.

An android is a humanoid robot[1] or synthetic organism[2][3][4] designed to look and act like a human, especially one with
a body having a flesh-like resemblance.[2] Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction
where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design 
of functional and realistic humanoid robots.
