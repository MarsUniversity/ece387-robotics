# Roomba Control

![iRobot Create 2](pics/create.png){width=33%}

In this lab we are finally going to play with the Roomba and start commanding
it to move around. This will prepare you for the final project with the Roomba.

You should learn or gain experience with:

- How to command the Roomba
- How to read the sensors and react accordingly
- How to monitor the Roomba robot

## Task 1: Simple Commanding

Start off commanding the robot to move forward for 5 seconds and the backwards
for 5 seconds.

Basic usage information can be found on: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycreate2

```python
	#!/usr/bin/env python
	from __future__ import print_function, division
	import pycreate2
	import time

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		# this creates the robot instance we will use
		bot = pycreate2.Create('/dev/ttyUSB0')
		bot.safe()

		# your code here
		# move forward
		time.sleep(5)
		# move backwards
		time.sleep(5)

		print('All done ... exiting :)')
```

## Task 2: Read Sensors in Real-Time

Now we are not going to command the robot to move anymore, but we are going to
read the sensors. With the robot standing completely still, read the light bumper
sensors, print the results to the screen, and use your hand to change the readings.

	# reading the IR sensors
	sen = bot.get_sensors()
	sen.light_bumper_left
	sen.light_bumper_front_left
	sen.light_bumper_center_left
	sen.light_bumper_center_right
	sen.light_bumper_front_right
	sen.light_bumper_right

	sen.cliff_left_signal
	sen.cliff_front_left_signal
	sen.cliff_front_right_signal
	sen.cliff_right_signal

```python
	#!/usr/bin/env python
	from __future__ import print_function, division
	import pycreate2
	import time

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		# this creates the robot instance we will use
		bot = pycreate2.Create('/dev/ttyUSB0')
		bot.safe()

		# your code here
		while True:  # press ctrl-c to end it
			sen = bot.get_sensors()
			# print the light bumper sensor readings

		print('All done ... exiting :)')
```

The point of this is to understand the values you need to avoid obstacles in the
next task.

## Task 3: Avoid Obstacles

Now write a program that runs and reads both the light bumpers and cliff sensors.
If the light bumpers detect something within ~2 inches, it should turn away. If
the cliff sensors values decreases too much (you will have to determine this
level), the back up and turn away from the obstacle.

## Task 4: Square

Now using your obstacle avoidance routine from above, have the Roomba travel
in a square that is 2 m on each side and end up in the same spot it started in.

**Note:** You will need to be able to command your Roomba to go places while simultaneously
avoiding obstacles in your path for the final project.

When you have this working, show your instructor. You still need to be able to
avoid obstacles while doing this, however, if something gets in your way, you
do not have to worry about ending in the same location you started in. Just complete the cube (best effort) after avoiding the obstacle.

Explain to your instructor the following questions:
- Did it work?
- How close were you?
- Why did this or why not did this work?
- How could you improve it?
